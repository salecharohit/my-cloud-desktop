# Cloud Desktop

What does this code do ?

- Spins up an EC2 Ubuntu Focal (:heart:) 
- Configures it with my most used softwares - VSCode,NMap,Nuclei,Semgrep,awscli and some pentest tools.
- Configure my Duck DNS domain name (rohit-salecha.duckdns.org) with the IP Address of the EC2 with LetsEncrypt Certificate. 
- Have a Source IP restriction such that it is accessible only from a specific IP Address like my home ip.

For more information about the setup and procedure please following along my blog here [https://www.rohitsalecha.com/project/my_cloud_desktop/](https://www.rohitsalecha.com/project/my_cloud_desktop/)
